    You will be able to upload as well as view “Jhanki” videos of aartis, darshans, functions, activities, celebrations, festivals, rituals and ceremonies from various temples to the Godly App in the “Jhanki” section (“Jhanki Content”). You will be paid an amount for every video that you submit to us as Jhanki Content and any videos that are uploaded to the Godly App. These amounts will be credited to you as Godly Tokens against your User Account, provided in the Terms. 
    This Jhanki Policy governs the uploading and display of Jhanki Content on the Godly App and any payments made by us to you for uploading Jhanki Content. This Jhanki Policy forms an integral part of the Terms.
      • Content Submission

      • You will be able to submit Jhanki Content for our review by uploading the content under the “Jhanki” section of a temple available on the Godly App and we shall pay you for your submission as per the terms of this Jhanki Policy.

      • All Jhanki Content submitted by you shall be reviewed by us and we reserve the sole right to decide whether it will be published and displayed on the Godly App, and to subsequently delete such Jhanki Content uploaded on the Godly App as we deem fit.

      • Content Requirements

      • Any Jhanki Content you provide to us must:

      • Any content that contains hate speech and propaganda: Any content, that in our sole discretion, promotes violent behavior or targets or shames  any particular religion, community, disability (physical or mental), caste, ethnicity, age, or gender; or intimidates any person; or has the intention of causing or spreading hatred or hate propaganda along the lines of community, religion, caste, ethnicity, age or gender.
      • Any content that promotes self-harm or violence: This includes any content that relates to physical, sexual, or psychological maltreatment, neglect or abuse of any person, including any content that showcases self-harm.

      • Unless Jhanki Content is of (i) publishable quality and (ii) pertains to the temple for which it is submitted, it will not be displayed on the Godly App. We will inform you via an in-App notification if your Jhanki Content will be displayed or not within [insert days] from your submission of the Jhanki Content.
