                   <p>Kashi Vishwanath temple is one of the most famous Shiva temples globally and attracts

                        thousands of devotees every day. The temple houses Shiva Jyotirlinga. The darshan of

                        the Jyotirlinga will give you a clean slate and clear all your bad Karma. It is blissful and

                        therapeutic. The darshan of the temple will help you lead a sin-free life. However, it is

                        not always possible for devotees to visit the temple physically. Covid-19 restrictions

                        have worsened the situation. Many people cannot travel to Varanasi to prostrate before

                        their beloved deity. For them, Godly Cloud brings Kashi Vishwanath live darshan.

                          <br>

                        Kashi Vishwanath live darshan will ensure that you enjoy all the benefits of the mandir

                        visit from the comfort of your own home. You can participate in Ganga aarti and chant

                        along with the purohits in the temple, with Kashi Vishwanath live darshan, only with

                        Godly Cloud.

                        <br>

                        Kashi Vishwanath is regarded as one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. Jyotirlingas are the

                        twelve most prestigious Shiva temples. Practitioners of Hinduism believe that visiting all

                        the jyotirlingas frees you from sins and bad Karma.

                          <br>

                        The benefits of visiting different jyotirlingas are different from one another. If you pray at

                        Kashi Vishwanath mandir, you will be free from all types of Karma.

                          <br>

                        Kashi Vishwanath temple is located at Vishwanath Gali, in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh.

                        While the reason for your pilgrimage to Varanasi maybe this Jyotirlinga- the city is home

                        to many more famous temples and deities.

                        The bliss of Kashi Vishwanath</p>





                    <h2>The bliss of Kashi Vishwanath Darshan</h2>

                    <p>Temples are a place where people rejoice in their belief in the almighty. The notion that

                        God is omnipresent is true, but the need for temples is undying due to our lack of focus.

                        Being in a place of worship helps us meditate and see a new perspective. Kashi

                        Vishwanath Darshan is no different.

                        Worshipping the destroyer, the almighty Shiva, makes the devouts feel blessed and

                        protected. The temple embraces the worshippers in a whiff of bliss and euphoria. Saints

                        from around the country visit the Kashi Vishwanath temple to be blessed by Lord Shiva.

                          <br>





                        Legend has it; if you visit Kashi Vishwanath mandir and pray with all your heart and

                        soul, all your sins will be washed away. You will get a clean slate of karmas. The fresh

                        start helps you achieve Moksha by practicing good deeds.

                          <br>

                        Though it&#39;s not always possible to worship your God in person, for that, Godly Cloud

                        brings you Kashi Vishwanath live darshan.</p>





                    <h2>Importance of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple</h2>

                    <p>Beside the banks of the holy Ganga, Varanasi is one of the holiest Indian cities. For

                        ages, famous saints and mahatmas have visited the Kashi Vishwanath temple to attain

                        Moksha. The opportunity to take a dip in the sacred Ganges is one of the many benefits

                        of visiting the Kashi Vishwanath temple. The dip in the Ganges is an add-on, but if you

                        want to enjoy all the benefits of visiting the Kashi Vishwanath Mandir, you can always

                        opt for Kashi Vishwanath live darshan.

                          <br>

                            <br>

                        Hindus from around the globe carry the aspiration to visit Kashi Vishwanath once in a

                        lifetime. Saints believe in attaining Moksha; you should make a pilgrimage to Kashi

                        Vishwanath in Varanasi and then to Rameshwar temple in Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu.

                        After visiting both the temples, you must give up one desire to get the best results. The

                        desire can be anything from as small as stop eating your favourite food to as big as

                        restraining from marriage.



                        <br>  <br>

                        Godly Cloud is here to help you attain bliss with Kashi Vishwanath live darshan.</p>





                    <h2>History of Kashi Vishwanath Dham</h2>

                    <p>Now you know the history of the temple. But still, a question remains, how did the

                        temple come into existence?

                          <br>

                            <br>

                        The temple of Kashi Vishwanath is mentioned in the Puranas. The legend has it that

                        once Lord Vishnu, the God of preservation, and Lord Brahma, the God of creation,

                        argued over supremacy.

                          <br>

                        To put an end to the conflict, Lord Shiva pierced the three worlds into an endless pillar

                        of light, i.e., the Jyotirlinga. Shiva challenged them to go around the Jyotirlinga, and the

                        winner of the race would be declared superior. To win the race, Vishnu took the form of</p>



                            <p>Varaha, i.e., a boar, and started searching for the pillar&#39;s bottom. On the other hand,

                              Brahma took the form of a swan and started the journey by flying in search of the pillar&#39;s

                              top.

                                <br>

                              Brahma lied and said that he came back after completing the round around the

                              Jyotirlinga to win the race. On the other hand, Vishnu accepted defeat and accepted

                              that he couldn&#39;t complete the round because he couldn&#39;t find the bottom. At this, Shiva

                              turned his wrath toward Brahma and beheaded Brahma&#39;s fifth head, which was lying.

                              Shiva further cursed Brahma that no one will worship him anywhere except one.

                                <br>

                              To reward the honesty of Vishnu, Shiva declared that Lord Vishnu will be treated as his

                              equal and will be worshipped by all for all eternity.

                                <br>

                              Since its founding, the Kashi Vishwanath temple has become one of the holiest

                              pilgrimage sites for Hindus. So what is the significance of the Jyotirlinga here? Read on.</p>

       

                   <h2>What do Jyotirlinga and Kashi Vishwanath Shivling represent?</h2>

                   <p>The Jyotirlinga is an ancient representation of axis Mundi (in astronomy, axis Mundi

                    represents Earth&#39;s axis between the Celestial Poles). Its endless and beginningless

                    pillar or lingam symbolized the infinite power of Shiva.

                      <br>



                    So Kashi Vishwanath shivling embodies the power of Shiva, which has no beginning or

                    end. The Jyotirling represents that Shiva is the core of creation and his supremacy is

                    formless.

                      <br>

                    All the twelve Jyotirlinga are named after the presiding deity, who are just different

                    forms of Shiva. All the Jyotirlinga have a primary image of Shivling, which represents his

                    limitless power and infinite nature.

                      <br>

                    So, if you want to bask in the glory of Lord Shiva, you cannot miss out on Kashi

                    Vishwanath. If you cannot visit the temple physically, go for Kashi Vishwanath live

                    darshan on Godly Cloud.</p>

               <h2>Structure of Kashi Vishwanath Mandir Varanasi</h2>

               <p>The Kashi Vishwanath temple&#39;s home- the Vishwanath Galli, is also home to several

                      other deities. The small shrines are dedicated to different gods, including Kaalbhairav,

                      Dhandapati, Vishnu, Vinayak, Avimukteshwaranand, Sanishwara, Virupaksha, and

                      Virupaksha Gauri.

                      <br>

                      The Vishwanath temple has two parts. First is the sabha griha, which is the grand

                      meeting and congregation hall. The second part is the inner Garbha Griha which is the

                      Sanctum Sanctorum. The linga is placed in the garbhagriha and is brown.

                      <br>

                      There is a small well in the temple too. The temple is said to hold wisdom and is called

                      Gyaan Vapi by the locals. The well sits at the north of the temple. At the time of the

                      Mughal invasion, the Jyotirlinga was hidden in the well to protect it from ruin. At the time

                      of the invasion, the legends have it that the Kashi Vishwanath temple&#39;s head priest

                      jumped in the well along with the Shiva Linga to protect it from invaders.</p>





                <h2>Attend Mahashivratri through Kashi Vishwanath Live Darshan App</h2>

                <p>The perfect day to get Kashi Vishwanath darshan is during Mahashivratri, the great

                  night of Lord Shiva. Fasting on Mahashivratri is a hundred times more beneficial than

                  other days.

                  <br>

                  <h2>FAQs</h2>



                    <h4> Q1)Why is the Kashi Vishwanath temple famous?</h4>

                    <p>The temple of Kashi Vishwanath, also known as the Shri Vishweshar temple, is one of

                    the twelve jyotirlingas. The jyotirlingas are dear to Lord Shiva as he proved his

                    supremacy over other gods by splitting the three worlds. The Lingams, which are

                    symbolic of Jyotirlingas, represent the eternal power and infinite vastness of Lord Shiva.</p>

                    <h4>Q2)What is the best time to visit Kashi Vishwanath Varanasi?</h4>

                    <p> Winter is the most beautiful season in Varanasi and is also the best time to visit the

                    Kashi Vishwanath Mandir. Indians enjoy winter from November to February. The

                    weather is calm, with a cool breeze around the day. Summers in Varanasi can be a bit

                    hot and harsh and should be avoided. To avoid summer and still get the best darshan,

                    opt for Kashi Vishwanath live darshan.</p>

                    <h4>Q3) Why is Kashi Vishwanath Mandir Banaras Important?</h4>

                    <p>Kashi is the spiritual centre of India. Along with the Kashi Vishwanath temple, the city

                    resides on the banks of the holy Ganges. Hinduism believes that if you die in Kashi or



                    get cremated in the city, you will be free from the process of rebirth and attain Moksha.

                    The city is a major attraction for pilgrims.</p>

                    <h4>Q4)How much time does it take for Kashi Vishwanath darshan?</h4>

                    <p>On a typical day, a visit to the temple can be around 2-3 hours. However, if you visit the

                    temple on an auspicious day, like Monday, mahashivratri, or pradosh, it might take

                    longer and cannot be predicted. Though, once inside, you can only stay in front of the

                    shivling for a few minutes because of the crowd and long lines.

                    To remedy this situation, Godly Cloud brings you Kashi Vishwanath live darshan. You

                    can attain the blessings of God from your home and stay in front of him for longer than a

                    few minutes.</p>

                    <h4>Q5) Where should I live in Varanasi?</h4>

                    <p>As Varanasi is a tourist location and a holy attraction, there are several high-end hotels

                    for your visit. If you are looking to save a few pennies, you can stay at the ashrams in

                    Varanasi. The ashrams are as good as three-star hotels and would give you the feel of

                    real Varanasi. Though what can be better than enjoying the darshan of Kashi

                    Vishwanath from home with your family. You can log on to Godly Cloud for Kashi

                    Vishwanath live darshan.</p>

                    <h4>Q6) What time is the Ganga Arti in Varanasi?</h4>

                    <p>The Ganga Arti in Varanasi occurs at Dashashwamedh ghat, which is the holiest of all

                    the ghats. The timing of Aarti varies in summers and winters. In the summers, the Aarti

                    takes place at 6:30 p.m. after sundown. In winter, the Aarti takes place at 7 p.m. You

                    can participate in Ganga Arti from home with the help of Godly Cloud.</p>
