                    <h2>Why should we opt for Siddhivinayak mandir Mumbai darshan?</h2>

                   <p>India is the land of spirituality that has attracted millions and millions of people worldwide.

                          Whether one doesnt consider India great or not, this country has attracted scientists,

                          philosophers, business tycoons, celebrities, and so on with its spiritual culture.

                             <br><br>

                          The <a href="https://mumbaicity.gov.in/tourist-place/siddhivinayak-temple/" class="d-inline-block text-center">government documents</a> give us beautiful insights into how the Siddhivinayak temple was

                          constructed. Built on 19 November 1901, the temple's original structure was relatively smaller

                          than today&s. Devotees believe this temple is a wish fulfiller; if a person visits this temple with

                          genuine desire, Ganpati Bappa makes it come true.



                          Unlike many Ganesh temples in the country, Siddhivinayak temples Ganesh murti has the trunk

                          in the left direction instead of the right side. This form is considered rare among the devotees of

                          Lord Ganesha. Another surprising fact about the Siddhivinayak temple is that no one knows

                          who carved Ganesh Murti. Devotees believe it to be self-manifested in order to bless the

                          devotees of Mumbai.</p>



                  <h2>Logical reasons behind taking Siddhivinayak live Darshan</h2>

                  <p>Several questions dawn upon many people when it comes to engaging in any spiritual activity.

                    We live in the 21st century; what,s the point of visiting any temple or taking a live darshan

                    through <a href="../index.html" class="d-inline-block text-center"> Godly Cloud.</a> app? Why should we adopt a spiritual/religious lifestyle? Aren,t we

                    supposed to believe in science and technology?

                    <br>

                    Well, Bhagavad Geeta often bags the classic literature title that captures Vedic thoughts and

                    philosophies in a nutshell of all the Vedic canon. Let,s read what this great book of wisdom says

                    about the above questions. Mind you, Bhagavad Gita goes by a reputation that whichever page

                    you open, you will get your answer.

                    Lord Krishna explains specific symptoms of a spiritualized soul to Arjuna. The following section

                    is adapted from Bhagavad Geeta 18th chapter,</p>



                    <h3>1. Start on the journey of self-realization with Shree Siddhivinayak live darshan</h3>

                    <p>What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? Why is there so much disparity and

                    injustice in the world? Many of us don't care about these questions. No material science can

                    answer these questions with experiments or scientific research because these topics are out of

                    science jurisdiction. Spirituality, however, offers us answers to this question that are almost

                    taboo in modern society. The more we become self-aware, the more we realize the meaning of

                    life. If Lord Ganesha is your Ishta devata, start watching Shree Siddhivinayak live Darshan

                    today to begin the process of self-realization.</p>





                    <h3>2. Attain a state of harmony with Shri Siddhivinayak live darshan</h3>

                    <p>The moment we become self-realized, we understand this material nature through knowledge

                      and devotion. This state of mind sprouts a sense of cheerfulness in our hearts, making our

                      negative thoughts turn to dust. Even <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/31/are-religious-people-happier-healthier-our-new-global-study-explores-this-question/" class="d-inline-block text-center"> modern research</a> states that a spiritual person is more

                      satisfied and happy with life than a non-spiritual counterpart. Watching Siddhivinayak live Aarti

                      today will fill your heart with this cheerfulness.</p>



                      <h3>3. Stay Equipoised to dualities of life with the blessings of Bappa</h3>

                      <p>In life, we often describe specific situations pleasurable based on our comfort level and certain

                        conditions as bad if things go wrong. Spirituality makes us rise above these dualities and

                        provides us with something that makes us unconditionally happy. We learn to live integrity and

                        harmony with nature and the divine. Every moment of our life, we count on blessings and

                        develop a habit of giving back to people. A spiritual person understands that nothing is another

                        control, and God is the ultimate controller. You will realize this fact the more you do Shree

                        Siddhivinayak live darshan.</p>

                      <h3>4. Exist in harmony with all living beings</h3>

                      <p>Spiritual people see a fellow human with equal vision. The compassion in their heart spreads

                            even to flora and fauna. In our present world, people's hearts are full of hatred and resentment

                            toward others. The spiritual consciousness makes us look at divinity in people. A religious

                            person naturally becomes more inclined toward charity. That's why many saintly people

                            dedicate their lives to altruism. India has hundreds of such saints who graced this country with

                            their selfless service, and still, many are doing the same.</p>

                        <h3>5. Come a step closer to become one with the divine</h3>

                        <p>Vedic scriptures describe four goals of human life: Dharma, Artha, Kama, and moksha. It never

                          put down any of these goals as vague. Moksha is the final destination of human life which we

                          can attain if we follow the previous three correctly. When a person lives by spiritual principles,

                          his life becomes more happy and worth living. We become more considerate in our relationships

                          in this world and relationships that go beyond this world. Start with meditating on Siddhivinayak

                          live darshan images, or you can buy an idol for worship.<br>

                          <a href="../index.html" class="d-inline-block text-center"> Godly Cloud.</a>  makes sure devotees will never face difficulties watching live videos of any temple.

                          That's why we have provided a search option where you can search the temple name and stay

                          digitally connected.</p>

                        <h3>Ganesh Chaturthi- a special time for doing Shree Siddhivinayak live darshan</h3>

                        <p>Millions of people in Maharashtra and other parts of India celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi or

                          Vinayaka Chaturthi with great pomp. This festival lasts for ten days. Devotees' hearts wash over

                      <p>These timings are usually followed in the temple; things have changed for now due to the Covid-

                     <h2>Before you watch online Darshan of Siddhivinayak Mumbai temple—know these facts</h2>

                     <p>Hindu temples have always faced severe criticism over massive donations. A few Bollywood

                          movies portrayed how some temples misuse funds donated by visitors and devotees. However,

                          films showed quite a biased understanding of temple use donations. The irony is none of those

                          movies donated a single penny from their box office collection to the poor or needy.

                          <br>



                          This section will shed light on some donations and public service done by the Siddhivinayak

                          temple.

                          <br>



                          In 2013, Siddhivinayak temple gave away its <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shirdi-temple-gives-away-53-earnings-siddhivinayak-13/articleshow/20020265.cms" class="d-inline-block text-center"> 13%</a>  of donation in charity.

                          <br>



                          In 2016, Siddhivinayak trust donated PM's scheme its  <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai/siddhivinayak-trust-to-help-needy-with-interest-earned-in-pm-s-scheme/story-V4T73uljCsEOiv0eUv2JmO.html" class="d-inline-block text-center"> 2.25%</a>interest earned on gold deposits.

                          <br>



                          Siddhivinayak temple also donated <a href="https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/other/siddhivinayak-temple-to-donate-rs-5-cr-for-governments-rs-10-shiv-bhojan-thali/articleshow/74309880.cms">five crore rupees </a> to the Maharashtra government for Shiv

                          Bhojan Thali's scheme that serves people whole meat at only Rs 10.

                          <br>



                          Not to mention, there are hundreds of employees working in the temple. The temple

                          management and monthly salaries also cost money. Not only Siddhivinayak temple but many

                          Hindu temples in times of trouble give away their wealth through donations. For example,

                          ISKCON fed more than   <a href="http://www.iskconparsippany.org/iskcon-worldwide/2020/10/9/50-million-meals-distributed-by-iskcon-in-india-and-worldwide-during-covid-19">50 million </a>people during the lockdown. Shirdi Trust donated a whopping

                          <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-shirdi-trust-to-donate-51-crore/article31187880.ece">₹50 crore </a> to the CM relief fund. It would be pretty unfair to label every Hindu temple as a

                          business, which is a logical fallacy of generalization. Neglecting these charities made by Hindu

                          temples from time to time and simply pointing out temple mismanagement is highly

                          condemnable.

                           <br>

                          <a href="../index.html" class="d-inline-block text-center"> Godly Cloud</a> understands the significance of Hindu temples in our day-to-day life. We have

                        <h2>FAQs</h2>



                        <h4>● Will watching Siddhivinayak live Aarti charge money?</h4>

                        <p>Watching Siddhivinayak live streaming or Aartis doesn't cost you money; it will only use up your

                          internet data.  <a href="../index.html" class="d-inline-block text-center"> Godly </a> not just provides you with live streaming of many temples for free, but short

                          clips of some temples as well. Devotees upload these short clips called Jhankis for the benefit

                          of others. You can upload Jhankis whenever you visit a temple.</p>



                          <h4>● What is the current status of Siddhivinayak temple online darshan booking?</h4>

                          <p>As per the  <a href="https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/siddhivinayak-temple-online-registration-new-covid19-rule-mumbai-687488" class="d-inline-block text-center"> media</a> reporting, the Siddhivinayak temple CEO has changed the usual rule

                              regarding darshan time in Siddhivinayak temple Mumbai to online booking for 100 devotees per

                              hour from 7 am to 9 pm. No changes in the present rule; considering rising Covid-19 cases, the

                              temple might come up with a new rule.</p>



                          <h4>● Which is the ideal day to take Siddhivinayak mandir live Darshan?</h4>

                          <p>Lord Ganesha is associated with auspiciousness. In Sanskrit, Mangalmurti is one of the names

                            attributed to him. Visiting Siddhivinayak temple on Tuesday is the best day as Mangalvaar is the

                            Sanskrit name of this day in a week. <a href="../index.html" class="d-inline-block text-center"> Godly Cloud</a> grants you an opportunity to take Shree

                            Siddhivinayak live Darshan whenever you desire.</p>





                          <h4>● Is there any best Aarti to attend in the Siddhivinayak live darshan app?</h4>

                          <p>Temple priests perform many Aartis throughout the day. The exciting Aarti happens in the early

                              morning called Kakad Aarti; this is part when devotees take Siddhivinayak Darshan and

                              immerse themselves in the devotion. Vedic traditions recommend taking early morning Darshan

                              whenever you visit any temple. You can attend Siddhivinayak live Aarti through <a href="../index.html" class="d-inline-block text-center"> Godly Cloud</a>.</p>



                          <h4>● Which is the dress code to wear before visiting the Siddhivinayak temple?</h4>

                          <p>The temple authorities don't impose any restrictions upon the outfits of the visitors. Like every

                            religious site, one must visit the temple in modest clothes. You can wear traditional dresses

                            such as saree and dhoti kurta. Indic clothes are quite apt attire to go before Ganpati Bappa and

                            take his blessings.</p>
