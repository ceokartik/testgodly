                   <P>Are you an ardent follower of Lord Shri Ganesha? If yes, then you must have

                            visited Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai. Mumbai’s Siddhivinayak Temple is

                            probably the most famous temple of Lord Ganesha. But if you are not a local

                            and wondering, Where is Siddhivinayak Temple located in Mumbai- we are

                            here to help you out.

                          </br></br>

                            Numerous reasons can stop you from visiting your favorite temple to attend

                            pooja or take blessings, such as if you are sick or out of town, settling abroad,

                            or stuck at home for some reason. Due to COVID-19 and lockdown, many

                            restrictions have disrupted our mundane activities, including going to the

                            temple.

                            </br>

                            To overcome this hurdle, we at Godly are allowing devotees to attend live

                            poojas and aartis. This service is available for a large number of temples which

                            you can choose on our app.

                  <h2>Where is Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai?</h2>

                  <p>Along with being the city of dreams, Mumbai is the city of religion. From Siddhivinayak to

                    Mahalaxmi to Haji Ali, Mumbai houses beautiful shrines. If you are in Mumbai, it’s highly

                    recommended that you do not miss out on the opportunity to visit these beautiful places of

                    worship.

                    </br>

                    The Siddhivinayak temple is located at Prabhadevi, Mumbai, Maharashtra. Prabhadevi is a

                    small upscale southern neighborhood of Mumbai. The area is surrounded by Dadar to the

                    north, Worli to the south and Arabian sea to the west.

                    </br>

                    Finding a car parking near Siddhivinayak temple can be a hitch due to the volume of people

                    visiting the mandir each and every day. Though once you are inside the temple, the serene

                    beauty and peace engulf you and give you the feeling of bliss. The temple is lined with

                    multiple kiosks, selling different artefacts, flowers, sweets to offer the lord and much more.

                    </br>

                    The temple houses a big Moushak Raj. It's said that if you whisper your wish in the ears of

                    the Moushak raj, your wishes will definitely come true. If you are unable to visit, Godly

                    Cloud brings to you live darshan. With Godly Cloud you can enjoy the darshan and bliss

                    without any hassle of parking and crowd.</p>

                 

                 <h2>Let,s have a look at the history of Siddhivinayak Temple Mumbai.</h2>

                 <p>Siddhivinayak mandir's construction took place in the 18th century. A

                  contractor named Laxman Vithu Patil constructed this massive shrine. Deubai

                  Patil funded this project. In a nutshell, Laxman Vithu and Deubai Patil built this

                  temple.

                  </br>

                  Who was Deubai Patil? She was a generous and rich woman belonging to the

                  Agri Samaj who built and renovated the whole temple. The lady came up with

                  the idea of erecting this temple during her prayer. As she was childless, she

                  prayed to Lord Ganesha, and her wish came true.

                  </br>

                  Another incident that took place 125 years ago is vital in understanding the

                  history of the temple. A Hindu saint Akkalkot Swami Samarth ordered his

                  disciple Ramkrishna Jambhekar Maharaj to bury two idols in front of the

                  temple's deity. This was carried out based on a prophecy which the saint was

                  aware of. The prophecy was that a mandar tree would grow at the same spot

                  after 21 years.

                  </br>

                  And indeed, after 21 years, a mandar tree grew on the same spot. The

                  realization of this prophecy affirmed the devotees’ faith, and since then, the

                  number of people visiting the temple increased in multiple folds.</p>





                  <h2>Let's have a look at the architecture of Siddhivinayak Temple Mumbai</h2>  

                  <p>If you compare the temple's image as it is today with its first construction, you

                    will find a massive difference in appearance. The original temple was just a

                    3.6m x 3.6m square brick structure with a dome-shaped tower. The temple

                    complex was quite large initially, close to 2550 sq. meters. The sanctum has

                    wooden doors at the entry point. This door has the images of Ashtavinayak

                    (eight manifestations of Lord Ganesha).

                    </br>

                    This vast space consisted of a lake, a rest house, and living quarters for

                    Siddhivinayak Ganapati mandir's caretakers. The lake was at the eastern and

                    southern part of the complex, about 30 x 40 sq mt, to fight water scarcity, but

                    this land does not belong to the temple as things stand now. The playground

                    near Siddhivinayak temple has initially been the lake used for other purposes.



                    A small Hanuman shrine is also present inside the temple complex. This

                    Hanuman temple came into existence when workers found Shree Hanuman's

                    idol while working for the road expansion project. The head priest of

                    Siddhivinayak mandir brought the idol and built a temple for it in the

                    Siddhivinayak temple complex.</p>



                      

                    <h2>Lord Ganesha's idol in Siddhivinayak mandir</h2>  

                    <P>Lord Ganesha's statue is in the center under the dome-shaped tower, gold

                        plated. This idol consists of a single giant stone. Two idols are on either side of

                        Ganesha's idol. The idols of Riddhi and Siddhi goddesses (wives of Lord

                        Ganesh) are present behind Lord Ganesha, and that's the main reason this

                        temple is called Siddhivinayak Ganpati Temple.</P>



                    <h2>Significance of the position of the trunk of Lord Ganesha</h2>

                    <p>Lord Ganesha's idol, which is present in Siddhivinayak temple, has unique

                      features. The trunk’s direction is right instead of what we generally see, which

                      is to the left. Siddhi is one of the two wives of Ganpati, and she resides on the

                      right side of Ganesha while Riddhi on the right.

                      </br>

                      “Siddhi” means to attain freedom from worldly pleasures. This state of

                      freedom is called ‘moksha.’ So, the Siddhivinayak’s trunk faces right- because it

                      is the deity that can grant you “moksha.”

                      </br>

                      Such a rare idol requires a particular type of worship practice. Worshipping the

                      right-sided trunk of Lord Ganesha’s idol can only be done after completing all

                      religious requirements and following a strict code of conduct. Devotees find

                      themselves quite lucky to worship this idol of Ganesha.

                      According to Hindu mythology, the human body is home to two energy

                      channels- called “Nadi.” On the right side lies the Pingala Nadi, which

                      represents the sun. On the left side lies the Ida Nadi.

                      </br>

                      Pingala is associated with vitality and strength- essential attributes that help

                      humans achieve their goals. The Siddhivinayak deity does precisely that- it

                      </br>



                      enables you to achieve your dreams, and the right-ward turn of its trunk

                      symbolizes that it embodies the same pranic energy as the Pingala Nadi.

                      </br>

                      <h2>Siddhivinayak Mantra</h2>

                      <p>The priest recites a few mantras at Siddhivinayak temple to bring success and

                          remove obstacles from your path.</br>

                          <b>“Om Sri Ganeshaya Namaha”</br>

                          The following mantra is peace, prosperity, and spiritual enlightenment.

                          knowledge.

                            “Where is Siddhivinayak Temple located in Mumbai?” should be the least of

                            your problem, now that we have explained it to you. Let's get to know how to

                            reach the temple from different routes.</P>





                        <h3>Flight</h3>

                        <p>If you are traveling from a different city/state/country, then it&#39;s only a 30-60

                        minute drive to Siddhivinayak temple from the domestic and international

                        airport. Once you land, take the route to South Mumbai by entering the city

                        </br>



                        through Bandra and continue till Worli. It&#39;s better if you opt for the Bandra-

                        Worli sea link to beat traffic. Once you reach Worli, the road takes you through

                        Mahim and Shivaji Park, which leads you to Prabhadevi.</p>



                        <h3>Road</h3>

                        <p>If you are traveling from the opposite side of the Flight route, then drive from

                          Tardeo to Kemps Corner, leading to Prabhadevi passing Haji Ali and Worli Naka

                          to reach Siddhivinayak mandir. It should not be challenging to travel as most

                          taxi drivers know this route as it&#39;s a pretty famous path in Mumbai.</p>



                          <h3>Train</h3>

                          <p>Siddhivinayak temple is quite close to Dadar railway station. This means that

                            visitors from both the Western and Central railway can easily reach the temple

                            through Dadar station. From the Dadar station, it&#39;s a 10-minute ride to the

                            temple, depending on traffic.

                            After reading the above information about the temple’s location and how to

                            reach it, we understand your doubt of “Where is Siddhivinayak Temple located

                            in Mumbai?” is solved.</p>





                            <h2>Post lockdown Rules to visit Shree Siddhivinayak Temple</h2>

                            <p>Since Covid-19 has forced us to go under lockdown, leading to public places

                              being closed, devotees cannot visit temples and perform poojas and aartis. As

                              the restrictions are no longer in function, Siddhivinayak temple came up with

                              its own set of rules and regulations for the public to follow to take Lord

                              Ganesha&#39;s blessings without breaking any protocols.</p>

                              <ul>

                                <li>People have to book their darshan online.</li>

                                <li>Show QRcode at the entry gates to enter the temple premises.</li>

                                <li>The timing for darshan will be from 8 am - 9 pm.</li>

                                <li>Offline registration is available at the counter outside the temple premises.</li>

                                <li>People should follow safety precautions such as wearing masks and social distancing to avoid the spread of COVID-19.</li>

                                <li>Only people with average body temperatures will be allowed inside the temple.</li>

                                <li>One hundred people are the maximum capacity of the temple according to safety rules.</li>

                                <li>Children below the age of 10 and senior citizens above 65 can’t enter the premises.</li>



                              </ul>

                              <p>With so many rules and regulations and people rushing for darshan bookings, it

                              won&#39;t be easy to get an early booking.

                              </br>

                              You can always opt for live darshan and pooja through our Godly cloud app.

                              This way, the risk of contracting Covid-19 is zero as compared to going out in

                              public places.</p>





                              <h2>Importance and status of Siddhivinayak Temple amongst its devotees</h2>

                              <p>Lord Ganesha is one of the most loved Gods in the Hindu pantheon. The

                                presiding deity of the Siddhivinayak mandir is Lord Ganesha. However, this

                                reason is enough to explain why this temple is so important and most visited

                                by people. Another reason is the devotees’ belief about the temple that it

                                grants their wishes attracts people to visit the temple.

                                </br>

                                Many high-profile Bollywood actors and politicians come to pray for their wish

                                to be granted. It is one of the wealthiest temples as it receives donations of

                                almost Rs 100 million per year.

                                </br>

                                Remember, when you are in the presence of Shree Siddhivinayak, you should

                                be respectful. After all, the mark of a true devotee is how willing they are to

                                dedicate themselves to their God. While visiting the temple, ensure you have

                                proper attire and observe all the ceremonial rituals for prayer.</p>

                                <h3>3. What is unique about Siddhivinayak Temple?</h3>

                                <P>A. Siddhivinayak temple is the most prestigious temple in Mumbai. Lord

                                Ganesha’s devotees believe that he makes their wish come true once you visit

                                the Siddhivinayak temple.

                                    </br>



                                One of Swami Samarth&#39;s prophecies came true when his disciple buried two

                                divine idols in front of the temple’s deity. The prophecy was that a mandar tree

                                would grow in the place of a buried idol after 21 years. This prophecy came to

                                be true after 21 years, and this influenced many people, and the number of

                                devotees increased hugely after this incident.

                                    </br>

                                There are two gates to enter the temple. One gate allows you to do a free

                                darshan, whereas the other gate leads you to a general darshan which takes

                                about 1 hour on average to complete. The option of paid darshan is also

                                available for the public, and it costs about Rs 50.</P>
