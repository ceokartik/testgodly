               <p>Shri Siddhivinayak temple Mumbai, located at Prabhadevi, is the chosen deity or Ishta Devata

                    of millions of Mumbaikars. If you plan to visit Mumbai or pay a visit to this temple, allow us to

                    provide you with Shri Siddhivinayak Aarti timings so that you won&#39;t miss a chance to enrich

                    yourself spiritually.

                    <br>

                    Whenever someone visits Mumbai, one can&#39;t help but hear the glories of this eye-pleasing

                    temple of Lord Ganesha from a local person. In Mumbai, the residents of this city affectionately

                    call Lord Ganesha &quot;Bappa.&quot; If you are a devotee of Bappa and would like to watch his Aarti,

                    note down the timings for the same.</p>



                <h2>The usual Aarti timings in Shri Siddhivinayak Temple</h2>

                <p>The following are the daily schedule of Shri Siddhivinayak Aarti timings. Keep in mind that the

                    idol (the correct Sanskrit word for the idol is Vigraha) is like a person we can serve. Shri

                    Siddhivinayak Ganapati devotees leave no stones unturned to serve Bappa through regular

                    rituals and activities that you can watch live on our  <a href="../index.html" class="d-inline-block text-center"> Godly Cloud.</a>  website.</p>



                    <ul>

                   <li>The first Aarti in Siddhivinayak temple starts at 5:30 am to 6:00 am. Devotees take

                      darshan in the early morning during Kakad Aarti. You can look for Siddhivinayak Kakad

                      Aarti lyrics in Hindi.</li>

                      <li>From 6:00 am to 12:15 pm, devotees take darshan of Bappa. One has to line up in an

                      always-moving queue. The devotees believe walking patiently in the queue for long

                      hours is like a test of faith.</li>

                      <li>12:15 pm is the time for lunch for Bappa called Naivedya, and it lasts till 12:30 pm. The

                      temple doors remain closed while devotees offer the food to the idol of Lord Ganesha.</li>    



                     <li> Devotees can take darshan from 12:30 pm to 7:20 pm; then comes the time slot of 7:30

                        pm to 8:00 pm for evening Aarti.</li>



                        <li> Ganpati Bappa gives the final darshan of the day from 8 pm to 9:50 pm.</li>



                        <li>The day ends with Shej Aarti at 9:50 pm. The temple remains closed after Shejaarti.   </li>

                      </ul>



                      <p>The temple devotees follow the above schedule throughout the week, except on Tuesday. On

                      Tuesdays, Shri Siddhivinayak temple has a unique schedule for Bappa, and it&#39;s slightly different

                      from the regular one. If you can&#39;t visit the temple due to the current Covid-19 outbreak, with the

                      blessings of Bappa, we have created  <a href="../index.html" class="d-inline-block text-center"> Godly Cloud.</a>  so that you won&#39;t miss any opportunity to

                      watch Siddhivinayak live Aarti.</p>





                  <h2>Check out Shri Siddhivinayak Aarti Timings on Tuesday</h2>

                  <ul>

                   <li>On Tuesday, Siddhivinayak temple opens sharply from 3:15 am to 4:45 am. You can

                      also take darshan during this time. Many devotees in Mumbai take padayatra (walking

                      journey) for this special darshan on Tuesday.</li>

                    <li>Kakad Aarti starts at 5:00 am to 5:30 am. One can take darshan from 5:30 am to 12:15

                      pm.</li>

                    <li> Naivedya ritual starts from 12:15 pm to 12:30 pm. After this, you can take darshan to

                    8:45 pm. Keep in mind at this time, Ganesha darshan is available from a distance.</li>

                    <li> From 9:30 pm to 10 pm, there is Aarti, but Shejaarti, the last Aarti, starts at 12:30 am.</li>       

                  </ul>



                  <h2>Why should you watch Siddhivinayak Live Aarti on Tuesday?</h2>

                  <p>In Hindu culture, specific days in a week belong to some gods. Tuesday is said to be a day

                    when devotees of Lord Ganesha prefer to fast. Like every Hindu God, Lord Ganesha is the Lord

                    of several divine qualities.

                    <br>

                    In Marathi, one of Siddhivinayak aarti lyrics addresses Lord Ganesha, &quot;Sukh Karta and Dukh

                    Harta,&quot; which means giver of happiness and remover of sorrow. He is also said to be the

                    embodiment of auspiciousness. Mangalwar is a Sanskrit translation of Tuesday; the word

                    Mangal means auspicious.<br>

                    If you try to corroborate the above reasons, you can understand why Lord Ganesha is extra

                    merciful on this particular day. Many devotees go to Siddhivinayak temple barefoot and take

                    darshan of Bappa in the early morning. We understand the Covid-19 pandemic has put us all

                    under restrictions. Created with devotional emotions,  <a href="../index.html" class="d-inline-block text-center"> Godly Cloud.</a>  will provide a spiritual

                    experience in these trying times.</p>



                    <h2>The schedule of Shree Siddhivinayak Aarti on Vinayaka Chaturthi</h2>

                    <ul>

                    <li>Kakad Aarti takes place from 5:30 am to 6 am. The darshan timing starts from 6 am to

                    7:30 am. As you can notice, the darshan at this time is shorter than the other days.



                     <li> The time slot of 7:30 am to 1:00 pm is for Abhishek, Naivedya, and Pooja Aarti. No

                      devotees are allowed during this special ceremony to Lord Ganesha.</li>



                      <li> Devotees can take darshan of Bappa from 1:00 pm to 7:20 pm; one can attend evening

                      Aarti at 7:30 pm that goes on till 8:00 pm.</li>



                      

                     <li> Visitors get the final opportunity to take darshan of Ganpati Bappa from 8:00 pm to 9:15

                      pm.</li>



                      <li> With Shej Aarti at 9:50 pm, the temple remains closed till the following day.</li>                  



                    </ul>



                    <p>Keep in mind Vinayak Chaturthi lasts for ten days as it is one of the most loved festivals in

                    Mumbai. Millions of devotees visit Siddhivinayak temple during these ten days. You can expect

                    a much larger crowd than average days. Godly Cloud will show you Siddhivinayak live Aarti if

                    you stay outside of India.</p>

                  <h2>The significance of the Shri Siddhivinayak temple</h2>

                  <p>India is the land of spirituality. In every street and corner, you will come across a temple. Many

                      highly enlightened souls have heralded India as the spiritual superpower of the world. No

                      wonder this ancient land of wisdom has enamored several spiritual seekers.

                      <br><br>



                      One of such holy places in the city that never sleeps is the Shri Siddhivinayak temple Mumbai.

                      Millions of devotees and visitors go to this temple yearly. The  <a href="https://mumbaicity.gov.in/tourist-place/siddhivinayak-temple/" class="d-inline-block text-center"> government documents</a> state the

                      contractor Laxman Vithu Patil built this temple on November 19, 1801. Since then, Siddhivinayak

                      mandir has become one of the most popular holy sites in Mumbai, visited by famous

                      personalities anytime in the year.</p>





                      <h2>Shri Siddhivinayak Temple Mumbai is unique and special</h2>

                      <p>The idol of Lord Ganesha has four hands in this temple. The upper right hand has a lotus, and

                        the upper left hand has an ax. The bottom right hand has a garland of pearls, and the left hand

                        has a bowl full of Modak. Lord Ganesha has his two wives by his side, Riddhi and Siddhi.

                        Unlike other Ganesh temples, Siddhivinayak Ganpati&#39;s idol has its trunk to the right side and not

                        the left. Devotees believe it to be a rare manifestation. The most surprising part is that the idol of

                        Siddhivinayak consists of a single Blackstone. Some stories explain that this idol is self-

                        manifested, and no one carved it.

                        <br>

                        Several devotees profess that Shree Siddhivinayak makes your wishes come true if you pray to

                        Bappa with an honest heart. Apart from its historical significance, you can also get spiritual

                        vibes while being in the temple as it is under spiritual vibrations throughout the day.

                      </p>



                      <h2>Why does Lord Ganesha want modak as prasad during Shree Siddhivinayak Aarti?</h2>

                      <p>As per a puranic story, Lord Shiva, with his family, Goddess Parvati and Lord Ganesha, visited

                        a lady named Anusuya in the forest. Lord Shiva said to this lady that he would honor the food

                        once she satiates Ganesha&#39;s hunger. No food was able to fill Lord Ganesha&#39;s stomach.

                        Helpless Anusaya gave him a single sweet, which made Lord Ganesha burp.

                        <br>

                        The moment Lord Ganesha burped, even Lord Shiva burped, not once but twenty-one times.

                        This story suggests that if you can please Lord Ganesha, you will please Lord Shiva. The sweet

                        happened to be modak, and it has become a mandatory offering to Lord Ganesha. Apart from

                        the story, modak has become a favorite Indian sweet dish for many people. Different parts of

                        countries have their recipes and flavors when they make this offering to Lord Ganesha.

                            <br>

                        During Ganesh Chaturthi, many devotees in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra

                        Pradesh, and so on prepare 21 modaks bhogas. Specially in Maharashtra, Ganesh Chaturthi is

                        one of the biggest festivals in this state; you will come across various types of modaks prepared

                        by the locals as offerings and later served as prasad, the sanctified food.</p>





                        <h2>The supreme mantra of Lord Ganesha</h2>

                        <p>Chanting various mantras is an integral practice in many rituals and ceremonies. Vedic literature

                          recommends chanting specific mantras to invoke the blessings of the chosen deity. Our

                          ancestors understood the effect some sound vibrations have on our brain thousands of years

                          ago.

                            <br>





                          For instance, a  scientific study    on the Gayatri Mantra identified a greater magnitude of the net

                          score when compared to poem chanting. Gayatri Mantra achieved a 21.67% score, and poem

                          chanting got 4.85%. It indicates the sound vibration of Gayatri Mantra was different from the

                          ordinary poem chanting.

                         <br>

                          Vedas glorify Lord Ganesha in many innovation prayers, however, some mantras have higher

                          spiritual potency. You should chant this mantra 108 times on a bead bag, probably on rudraksha

                          mala. Chanting this mantra will not only provide you with success in material life, but you can reap

                          spiritual benefits as well. Here is the mantra: OM GAN GANAPATAYE NAMAH.</p>





                          <h2>The impact of Covid-19 pandemic on Siddhivinayak Mumbai</h2>

                          <p>American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan once sang a song, &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin.&quot;

                            Indeed, times have changed a lot since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. No one thought

                            the world would change in such a dramatic way.

                                <br>

                            Siddhivinayak Mandir Mumbai reopened in November 2020, but it seems 2021 won&#39;t be any

                            different. We are a few months into this year, and there is a surge of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai

                            again.



                            The temple authorities have a new rule to tackle this situation and comply with the government&#39;s

                            policies. The darshan will be available to the devotees only through online registration, effective

                            from March 1. Only 100 online registered devotees will get a chance to visit the temple.

              <br>

                            Priyanka Chhapwale, CEO of Siddhivinayak temple, has informed the <a href="https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/siddhivinayak-temple-online-registration-new-covid19-rule-mumbai-687488"> media </a>, they have stopped

                            on the spot QR code to the devotees who wanted to visit the temple. The only way to visit the

                            temple is through online registration. The darshan of Bappa is allowed between 7 am to 9 pm.

    <br>

                            We understand that the times are pretty challenging but don&#39;t feel down. We have come up with

                            a solution for you so that you can take blessings from your home. Made with love and devotion,

                            <h2>FAQs</h2>



                            <h4>● Why are there so many Aartis at Siddhivinayak temple?</h4>

                            <p>A question may pop up in your mind: why attend any aarti, take darshan, and be done with it?

                            The answer lies in ancient Vedic tradition. Whenever a devotee participates in Aarti, it is an act

                            of humility and gratitude. Much of the Hindu rituals focus on immersing one&#39;s senses in the

                            thought of deity. Shree Siddhivinayak mantra and Aarti will give you a spiritual experience as it

                            involves call and response prayers, engaging your eyes, tongue, and ears in the service of the

                            Lord. You can get to know everything about Shri Siddhivinayak Aarti timings on our website

                            <a href="../index.html" class="d-inline-block text-center"> Godly Cloud.</a> </p>



                            <h4>● How to go about the online booking process?</h4>

                            <p>You can download the mobile application from the Play Store for booking, but you may have to

                              plan a specific date because of the limited slots. Considering the current scenario, it is quite a

                              challenge to get an available slot.</p>





                              <h4>● What is the distance between Shri Siddhivinayak temple and Mumbai airport?</h4>

                              <p>From Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, you can reach Siddhivinayak Temple via

                                Western Express Highway in just 25 minutes drive. You can book Ola or Uber for traveling

                                convenience. You can also try other vehicle facilities since, as of March 2021, the Mumbai

                                locals are not fully available.</p>







                                <h4>● Has the Covid-19 pandemic affected the timings of the Shri Siddhivinayak temple?</h4>

                                <p>The timings of the temple in Mumbai have been fluctuating due to the Covid-19 pandemic. You

                                  have to do online registration before visiting the temple. The latest rule allows only a hundred

                                  devotees to enter the temple per hour. The current rule can change if Covid-19 cases shoot up

                                  again.</p>



                                  <h4>Which is the best attire to wear before visiting the Siddhivinayak temple?</h4>

                                  <p>The temple authorities have not imposed a strict dress code on devotees. They allow people to

                                    wear clothes as per their choice but expect them to maintain religious place’s dignity. The

                                    traditional outfit is highly recommended. For women: a sari. For men: dhoti-kurta. Follow  <a href="../index.html" class="d-inline-block text-center"> Godly Cloud.</a>  to stay updated with Shri Siddhivinayak Aarti timings.</p>



                                    <h4>Which is the best day to visit Shri Siddhivinayak temple?</h4>

                                    <p>Lord Ganesha is extra merciful on Tuesdays. However, you can also visit the temple during

                                        Ganesh Chaturthi and other related festivals to the Lord. Many local devotees visit the temple

                                        regularly. Considering the current pandemic, you should plan as per the guidelines set by the

                                        temple and the government. Our website,  <a href="../index.html" class="d-inline-block text-center"> Godly Cloud.</a> , will keep you updated.</p>
